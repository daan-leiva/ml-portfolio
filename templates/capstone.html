      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project explores the use of <strong>Support Vector Machines (SVMs)</strong> to predict genotypes based on allele intensity data collected via <em>OpenArray™ SNP genotyping technology</em>.
        The goal is to improve the accuracy of genotype predictions—especially in assays with low signal separation—thereby reducing costs and improving confidence in results.
      </p>

      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimize an SVM model (linear vs. RBF) for genotype prediction.</li>
        <li>Target challenging assays with low Minimum Cluster Sigma Separation (MCSS).</li>
        <li>Validate the model’s accuracy using k-fold cross-validation.</li>
        <li>Test prediction performance on non-majority genotype samples.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data & Methodology</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> 3,506 failed assays with MCSS < 5; 263 were labeled discrepant.</li>
        <li><strong>Features:</strong> Fluorescence intensities (VIC for allele 1, FAM for allele 2).</li>
        <li><strong>Labeling:</strong> Genotype ground truth assigned using a 70% majority threshold.</li>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Python (<code>scikit-learn</code>), R, SQLite.</li>
        <li><strong>Models Tested:</strong> Linear SVM (fast but less accurate) vs. RBF SVM (more accurate, slower).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After hyperparameter tuning, the best-performing model used an RBF kernel with
        <strong>C = 0.3</strong> and <strong>γ = 300</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overall accuracy:</strong> ~74.6%</li>
        <li><strong>High performance:</strong> Homozygous genotypes (11 and 22)</li>
        <li><strong>Low performance:</strong> Heterozygous genotypes (12), due to poor separability</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-validation:</strong> 4-fold CV confirmed generalizability</li>
        <li><strong>Prediction cohesion:</strong> Strong performance even on non-majority genotype samples</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        The RBF SVM outperformed the linear model in both accuracy and prediction consistency. While homozygous genotype predictions were reliable,
        predicting heterozygous samples remains a challenge. Future improvements could involve additional feature transformation or deeper models.
